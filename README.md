# HacktoberFest 2021

👉**What on earth is HacktoberFest?**

So a group of companies wanted to spread the word about Open Source, so they decided to keep a month long virtual event, where they reward you if you contribute to open source organisation/repositories. 

They give you **T-shirts** and other cool swags if you contribute to repos/issues tagged under the hacktoberfest label. 

I am gonna help you get that **T-shirt** and also get you started with your open source journey. 

All you need to do is open 4 Pull Requests (Relax, Just read along).

**Start your Open source Journey in Wimpy Style.**

👉First step is to get registered [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

👉Now that you registered, you need to make 4 PRs, but sadly you have no idea what the fu*ck that means. 

<p  align="center"> 💕 Dont Worry </p>

Just start by watching the following videos in the given order.
